        <h2>Senior Sport Management Major from Atlanta, Georgia</h2>
        
         <p>I am a senior at Bob Jones University studying Sport Management with a minor in Coaching. I work in the DFH as a court manager. 
            I hope to coach hockey at the collegiate level one day.</p>
         <p>
           Some of my hobbies are sports, music, reading, and gaming. I also enjoy spiritual conversations and talking about my faith. 
           My favorite Bible verse is Isaiah 41:10
         </p> 
         <p>
            My favorite hobby is by far sports. I am an avid sports fan. My top favorite teams as of right now are the Seattle Kraken (NHL), 
            Alabama Crimsom Tide (NCAA), the Los Angeles Lakers (NBA), and the Los Angeles Dodgers (MLB).
